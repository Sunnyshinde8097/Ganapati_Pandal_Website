# Ganapati_Pandal_Website
############# INTRO #######################

1) The project has been divided into two verticals.
	i) The frontend
	ii) The backend
2) The frontend is designed in HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
3) For the backend, we have used Python with the Flask framework.
4) For data preparation, we have used MS Excel, and to load the data into the database, we have used MySQL Workbench.

############## WEBSITE ######################

1) When we run the code, we first redirect to the home page, which has a navbar (Home,Services, Live Darshan, About Us). 
   By clicking on any of the options, we get redirected to the relevant path.
2) Example: When we click on services, we get redirected to where we have 2 cards. 
   One is Ganesh Darshan and the other is Ganesh Aarti cards, where we have a button on both the cards.
3) When we click on the Ganesh Aarti cards' "go" button, we get redirected to the Ganesh Aarti website, 
   and similarly, when you click the "go" button on the Ganesh Darshan card, we get redirected to the Padals information page.
4) Pandals' information page consists of famous Ganpati padals' information from various cities. We have a drop down to select a city to filter the data from and, 
   by clicking on the go button, we get the relevant data from the particular city. We can even get the Google location by clicking the click, which is in the location column.
5) and we have a "map" button over the data table. When we click on it, we see a map where we can see cities with the count of pandals on them. 
   For example, Mumbai has 14 famous pandals, Pune has 5, Thane 2, and Hyderabad 2, etc.
6) When we return to the home page, we see "live Darshan" in the navbar. On clicking, we can see 3 cards with the button Live Darshan. On clicking, 
   we get navigated to the live dershan pages provided by the padals.
7) Last but not the least, we have a chat box, which is at the right bottom corner of the page. The chat box is designed on Javascritp.
8) When we say hello, it responds with "Hey, hello, type the city name to get information. When we type any city name, it will give us a link that has information about the padals.
